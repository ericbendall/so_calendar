# SO Calendar

A cute way tell your significant other why you like them everyday.

Heavily under development. Don't judge me yet.

## TODOS:

### Iteration 1
- [x] Create mongo DB database and get the store drawing from it
- [x] Populate database with some data, essentially create some sort of seeding mechanism
- [x] turn that data into a UI consummable list (just a list for now, the grid will introduce crazy edge cases)
- [x] Create Garbage UI
- [x] Create ability to move from one cell to another
- [x] Less Garbage UI
- [x] Animations
- [ ] Deploy with fake data
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Deploy Auth, test
- [ ] Truly Majestic UI
- [ ] Seed with real data, deploy
- [ ] Profit

### Iteration 2
- [ ] update calendar
- [ ] Complete with route, editor and shit

### Iteration 3
- [ ] create new calendar

### Iteration 4
- [ ] handle new users and auth
